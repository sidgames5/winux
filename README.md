# winux

Is it windows? Is it linux? I canâ€™t tell!

Winux is a collection of customizations, configurations, and applications to make linux look as similar to windows as possible.

## Goals

- Provide a gentle introduction to linux and the command line
- Provide a familiar user interface for the smoothest and easiest transition

## Currently supported versions

- Winux 10
